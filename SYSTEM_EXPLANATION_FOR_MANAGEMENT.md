## üåê APIs We Use

### **1. Keepa Product API**
**What it is:** Third-party service that provides Amazon product data  
**What we call:** `https://api.keepa.com/product`  
**How often:** Every hour for each product (95 products = 95 API calls/hour)  
**Cost:** ‚Ç¨49/month for 892,800 API calls  

**Data we get from Keepa:**
- **Product Information:** Title, brand, ASIN
- **Sales Rankings:** Current rank in each Amazon category
- **Category Tree:** All categories the product appears in
- **Pricing Data:** Current price and availability
- **Monthly Sales Estimates:** Approximate sales volume

**Example API Response:**
```json
{
  "asin": "B01M16WBW1",
  "title": "Queen Size 4 Piece Sheet Set",
  "brand": "Mellanni",
  "salesRanks": {
    "85939011": [7354468, 1],  // Category ID: [timestamp, rank]
    "1055398": [7679528, 2]    // Rank #1 = Best Seller!
  },
  "categoryTree": [
    {"catId": 85939011, "name": "Sheet & Pillowcase Sets"},
    {"catId": 1055398, "name": "Home & Kitchen"}
  ]
}
```

### **2. Slack Web API**
**What it is:** Slack's official API for sending messages  
**What we call:** `https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage`  
**How often:** Only when badge changes occur  
**Cost:** Free  

**What we send:**
- **Best Seller alerts** with product details
- **Daily summaries** of all activity
- **System status** notifications

### **3. Supabase Database API**
**What it is:** Our cloud database for storing all tracking data

**How often:** Continuously (storing results, retrieving ASINs to check)  
**Cost:** ~$10/month

## üîç How Best Seller Detection Works

### **Step-by-Step Process**

1. **Product Monitoring**
   - System checks each ASIN every 60 minutes
   - Calls Keepa API to get current sales rankings
   - Stores complete response in database

2. **Badge Detection Logic**
   ```
   IF product rank = 1 in ANY category:
       Product has Best Seller badge
   ELSE:
       No Best Seller badge
   ```

3. **Change Detection**
   - Compare current badges with previous check
   - Identify gained badges (wasn't #1, now is #1)
   - Identify lost badges (was #1, now isn't #1)

4. **Notification Trigger**
   - If badges gained ‚Üí Send "üéâ GAINED Best Seller" alert
   - If badges lost ‚Üí Send "‚ö†Ô∏è LOST Best Seller" alert
   - Include product details, category, and ranking change

### **Example Detection Scenario**
```
Previous Check: B07CRZQ9MY ranked #3 in "Wax Warmers"
Current Check:  B07CRZQ9MY ranked #1 in "Wax Warmers"
Result:         GAINED Best Seller badge ‚Üí Send Slack alert
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Parent ASINs and Variations

### **What Are Parent ASINs?**
Amazon products often have **variations** (different colors, sizes, etc.) that share a **parent ASIN**. For example:
- Parent ASIN: B01M16WBW1 (Sheet Set)
- Child ASINs: B01M16WBW2 (Blue), B01M16WBW3 (White), etc.

### **How We Handle Variations**

**Current Approach:**
- We track **specific ASINs** (usually the main/parent ASIN)
- Each ASIN is monitored individually
- Rankings are specific to that exact variation

**Why This Works:**
- **Best Seller badges apply to individual ASINs**, not parent groups
- Amazon shows "#1 Best Seller" for specific products
- Our clients care about specific product performance

**Example:**
```
Tracking: B01M16WBW1 (Queen Size Sheet Set - Gray)
Status:   #1 Best Seller in "Sheet & Pillowcase Sets"
Alert:    "Your Gray Queen Sheet Set is now #1!"
```

### **Parent ASIN Considerations**
- **We can track parent ASINs** if that's what you want monitored
- **Child variations** may have different rankings
- **Best practice:** Track the main/bestselling variation of each product
